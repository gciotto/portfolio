	<h3 class = "section_title">Projet de Synthèse</h3>

	<h3 class = "text">This project was realized in the end of the first year of the engineering course and its objective was to implement the MUSIC algorithm which is basically used to detect frequencies in noised signals. It uses the autocorrelation matrix of the input signal and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors to determine if a frequency is part of that noise or not. All the sources files were written in Matlab and can be found in this <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gciotto/projet-synthese/tree/master/src">Github repository</a>. The final report is equally available <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/projet-synthese/blob/master/report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</h3>
	
	<hr width="75%" align="CENTER" size="1" noshade="">	

	<a name="logiciel"></a>
	<h3 class = "section_title">Projet de Développement Logiciel</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "text">The software development project, realized in the beginning of the second year, consisted of implementing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire" target="_blank">Peg solitaire game</a> in Java language. Our missions were to develop an user graphical interface based on the swing framework and an effective AI that could leave the table with the smallest number of pieces. Many design patterns were equally used during the development. We based our AI on the Branch and Bound algorithm. <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/projet-logiciel/tree/master/model" target= "_blank">UML diagrams</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/projet-logiciel/blob/master/report.pdf" target= "_blank">report</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/projet-logiciel/tree/master/src" target= "_blank">source codes</a> are all available!</h3>

	<a name="conception"></a>
	<h3 class = "section_title">Projet de Conception</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "text">The last project developed at Ecole Centrale Supélec consisted of another game, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago" target="_blank">Pentago</a>, written in Matlab. The main purpose of this project was to implement an AI capable of beating our advisor's. To achieve this, we based our solution on the alpha-beta search algorithm to analyze and choose the future moves. In the end, we obtained great results compared to our advisor's AI, being able to beat it in more than the half of the simulated matches. All GUI was developed in Matlab as well. The report is available <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/projet-conception/blob/master/report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and the source codes, <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/projet-conception/tree/master/src" target="_blank">here</a>.</h3>
