	<h3 class = "section_title">EA072 - Artificial Intelligence in Industrial Applications</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "text">The first exercise covers two fundamental features in artifical intelligence: training and validation of two types of neural networks (MLP and ELM) and variable selection through the use of correlation filters and wrapper methods such as forward selection and backward elimination. In this project, we used real world data sets about the number of registered cases of dengue in São Paulo in the last years. The report can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EA072/raw/master/project1/report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and the source code was separated in two directories: the <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EA072/tree/master/project1/src/selecao_variaveis" target="_blank">first</a> for the implementation related to the variable selection techniques and the <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EA072/tree/master/project1/src/predicao" target="_blank">second</a> for the neural networks.
	
	<br><br>The second exercise explores three different concepts of the artificial intelligence field. For the first part of the exercise, we used genetic algorithms to determine the parameters of a PID controller. The second part consisted of using the software Eureqa to approximate functions and to understand the concepts involving the Pareto optimality (tradeoff between cost and efficiency of the solution). Finally, we simulated the behavior of a robot whose objective was to move to the end point of the map without hitting the walls or the obstacles. In order to achieve this goal, we implemented two different kinds of control, one based on a fuzzy logic and another, on neural networks, and compared them. All files related to this exercise are present in this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EA072/tree/master/project2" target="_blank">repository</a>. 

    <br><br>In the third and last exercise, we explored decision trees and bayesian networks. Report can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EA072/tree/master/project3/report" target="_blank">here</a>.</h3>

	<h3 class = "section_title">MC302 - Object Oriented Programming</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "text">The activity developed during this course consisted on a library management system, capable of managing book loans and registering users. We used the Java language and explored many design patterns during the system development such as Prototype, Abstract factory and Adapter. The source code can be accessed at this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC302/tree/master/src" target="_blank">directory</a>.</h3>

	<h3 class = "section_title">MC404 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "text">Personally, this is the course I enjoyed the most during my years at UNICAMP. The ARM architecture was adopted during this course, so all exercises were developed using the ARM ISA. You will find in this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC404" target="_blank">directory</a> either short exercises or longer projects. Concerning the latter:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		  <li><a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC404/tree/master/project1" >Project 1 - IAS Assembler</a>: we wrote a C program which received two files as parameters: the first one contains a program source code with ARM instructions that will be translated to hexadecimal codes and stored into the file whose path was specified in the second parameter. The main project source code file, containing the most important functions, can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC404/blob/master/project1/montador_ias.c" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
		  <li><a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC404/tree/master/project2" >Project 2 - scanf and printf</a>: the goal of this project was to implement in ARM language the functions scanf and printf provided by the standard C stdio library. The implementation of the first one can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC404/blob/master/project2/myscanf.s" target="_blank">myscanf</a> and the latter at <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC404/blob/master/project2/myprintf.s" target="_blank">myprintf</a>.</li>
		  <li><a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC404/tree/master/project3">Project 3 - simple os</a>: the objective of this project was to program a simple OS, capable of initializing new processes (implementation of the fork() syscall), switching between process contexts, enabling and disabling interruptions etc. The main source code directory can be accessed at this <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC404/tree/master/project3" target="_blank">link</a>.</li>

	<h3 class = "section_title">MC536 - Databases: Theory and Practice</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "text">The project realized during this course consisted on a system capable of searching a database containing many figures. The user could choose between searching by writing tags relative to the images or by uploading a similar image into the system. The project was programmed in PHP and C++ and we used a MySQL server. Source codes available <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/MC536" target="_blank">here</a>.</h3>

	<h3 class = "section_title">EA080 - Laboratory of Computer Networks</h3>

    <h3 class = "text">Six laboratory sessions were assigned to the students during this course. They explored general concepts of computer networks and its protocols such as ARP, TCP, UDP, IP, DHCP, NAT etc. We also learned to set and configure routers in order to use statically or dynamically created routes and IP addresses. Most of the network traffic data was captured by the Wireshark software. All reports can be found in the course's Github <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EA080">repository</a>.</h3>

	<h3 class = "section_title">EA532 - Applied Electronics</h3>

	<h3 class = "text">Four exercises were developed during this course. In general, those exercises consisted of simulations realized using <a href="http://www.orcad.com/products/orcad-pspice-designer/overview" target="_blank">PSpice</a> and covered some basic circuits with operational amplifiers and MOSFET / bipolar transistors, such as inverters, integrators, rectifiers etc. The reports can be accessed through the  links <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EE532/raw/master/project1/report.pdf">project 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EE532/raw/master/project2/report.pdf">project 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EE532/raw/master/project3/report.pdf">project 3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EE532/raw/master/project4/report.pdf">project 4</a>.</h3>

	<h3 class = "section_title">EA076 - Laboratory of Embedded Systems</h3>

    <h3 class = "text">During the laboratory sessions, we explored many features of NXP's KL25Z development board, such as IOs, DA/AD converters, I2C interfaces, UART, PWM, interruptions etc. In the last project, we used another board, STM32F7 Discovery, to communicate via serial and send commands to the KL25Z. Considering the latter provides a LCD touchscreen, we had to implement a graphical interface in addtion to the communication protocol itself. All sessions and final project can be found in the course's Github <a href="https://github.com/gciotto/EA076">repository</a>.</h3>
